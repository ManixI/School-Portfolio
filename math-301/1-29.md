if `n ∈ Z` then `4n^2 - 7n` is composit
`n(4n - 7) = a`
composit is if a num has a factor beyond `a` and 1
`a` is composit because `n` is always a factor

if `a,b ∈ Z,` then `a|a(a+b)`
`a|c` if `a` is a factor of `c`
`a` factor is when a number `n` multiplied by another number `m` is equal to a where `n,m ∈ Z`
`a` will always be a factor of `a(a+b)` because `a(a+b)` will always be positive, always be bigger or equal to `a`, and `a` multiplied by any number `n, n ∈ Z` will always be a factor of `an`

if `s,t` are odd, then `st` is odd and if `s,t` are even then `st` is even
