<h1>Constraint Satisfaction Problems</h1>
<p>In this assignment, you'll perform search on a graph coloring problem:
  Given a graph, and a set of colors that may be applied to each vertex,
  find a way to color the vertices such that any
  two vertices that are adjacent (i.e., connected by an edge) have
  different colors. A solution to this problem is a coloring of all
  the vertices. In some situations, a solution may not exist.

  Consider the graph below:

  <pre>
    0 ----- 1
    |       |
    |       |
    2 ----- 3
  </pre>

  If we allow the colors 'R' and 'B' for each vertex, it is possible to
  assign 0 and 3 the color 'R' and the vertices 1 and 2 the color 'B' (and vice
  versa). So, two distinct solutions exist which we can represent as ('R', 'B', 'B', 'R')
  and ('B', 'R', 'R', 'B').

  By modifying the graph with a diagonal edge
    <pre>
    0 --- 1
    |   / |
    | /   |
    2 --- 3
  </pre>

    It is no longer possible to color the vertices with just two colors.  We now need 3.
    
    <h2>Problem Representation</h2>

    Graph coloring problems will be supplied to your code as two data structures:
    a graph and the legal colors that may be applied to each vertex (the domains
    of each vertex).

    The graph is given in adjacency set representation using python's builtin dictionary
    and set data structures. So, a graph is a dictionary mapping integer vertex id's
    to sets of integers representing the destinations of outgoing edges.  For the square
    graph:

  <pre>
    0 ----- 1
    |       |
    |       |
    2 ----- 3
  </pre>

  The adjacency set representation would be:
  <pre>graph = {0: {1, 2}, 1: {0, 3}, 2: {0, 3}, 3: {1, 2}}</pre>

  For the modified square graph:
   <pre>
    0 --- 1
    |   / |
    | /   |
    2 --- 3
  </pre>
  The adjacency set representation would be:
  <pre>graph = {0: {1, 2}, 1: {0, 1, 3}, 2: {0, 1, 3}, 3: {1, 2}}</pre>

  The stub code comes with functions that load graphs from a string/file
  representation (which is slightly different than the string representation
  of the python data structure). A number graphs have been included
  in the .g files included in the handout.

  In addition to a graph, the coloring problem must specify the allowable colors
  for each vertex.  These are given via a second dictionary that maps
  vertex id's to sets of "colors".  For example, the dictionary:
  <pre> domains = {0: {'R', 'B'}, 1: {'R', 'B'}, 2: {'R', 'B'}, 3: {'R', 'B'}}</pre>

  indicates that each vertex in the graph above could be colored either 'R' or 'B'.
  
  <pre> domains = {0: {'R'}, 1: {'B'}, 2: {'R', 'B'}, 3: {'R', 'B'}}</pre>

  indicates that vertex 0 must be 'R', vertex 1 must be 'B' and vertex 2 and 3 can be
  either color.

  <h2> Required Interface </h2>

  The interface required for this assignment is minimal, so you have lots of
  flexibility in terms of how you implement search for a legal coloring.
  You must implement a class called CSP which has a method solve()
  that takes four optional arguments:
  <b>solutions</b> (an integer); <b>count</b> (a boolean); <b>allstats</b> (a boolean)
  and <b>quiet</b> (a boolean).  See the stub code for details.

  <h2> Partial State Representation and AllStats </h2>

  Typically, Constraint Satisfaction Problems are solved with a depth
  first search through a partial state representation of the space as
  discussed in class.  In our problem, each vertex in the graph we're
  coloring needs to be assigned one of the colors from its domain
  subject to the constraint that no two adjacent vertices have the
  same color.  The state space of the problem can thus be defined as
  a list (or tuple) of length <i>nvertices</i>.  In the partial state
  representation, we start with each vertex having no assigned color,
  and then we assign colors incrementally until we determine that a
  constraint is violated or we find a solution.

  Recall that in the formulation where we assign one vertex a color at
  each step (or at each ply in the search graph), all solutions lie at
  a depth equal to the number of vertices.  Further, we often
  will be able to stop searching down a path before we get very deep
  because a constraint is violated along the way.

  In the graph:
  
  <pre>
    0 ----- 1
    |       |
    |       |
    2 ----- 3
  </pre>

  Where each vertex has a domain of {'R', 'B'}; there are 2^4 possible colorings,
  all of which live at depth 4 in the search tree. However, of these, only 2 are legal.
  Assume we assign vertices values from the domain in numerical order:  To
  perform depth first search in the space of partial vertex color assignments, we begin
  by enqueuing a state with no assigned coloring, and then incrementally color one node at
  a time.

  The first state we enqueue, is therefore (?, ?, ?, ?). From here we
  generate (and enqueue) the two successors: ('R', ?, ?, ?) and ('G',
  ?, ?, ?).  If we next look at the two successors of ('R', ?, ?, ?):
  ('R', 'R', ?, ?) and ('R', 'G', ?, ?), we notice that ('R', 'R', ?,
  ?) cannot be part of a solution, since it already violates the
  constraints of the coloring problem.  Thus, we can prune this
  branch, and we don't need to look at any of the remaining 4 leaf
  nodes that assign colors to nodes 2 and 3.

  The <b>allstats</b> argument to the CSP.solve() method asks you to
  compute, and return statistics about the search.  In the graph
  above, we would start of the search with 2^4 'Unexplored' solutions;
  initially this is the number of fully specified states in the state
  space (here, four vertices, two colors each). Each time we add a
  partially specified state to the queue (including the first state
  (?, ?, ?, ?)) we increment the number of 'Enqueued' states. Each
  time we prune a branch, we determine how many <b>fully specified</b>
  states are descendants of that branch, and remove this value from
  'Unexplored' and add it to 'Rejected'.  So, after we prune the
  branch at ('R', 'R', ?, ?), we would reduce 'Unexplored' by 4, and
  add 4 to 'Rejected'.  If we're counting all solutions, the sum of
  'Rejected', 'Unexplored', and 'SolutionCount' will always be fixed.

  Note that my description of the enqueuing process above differs slightly
  from the book's pseudocode which uses a recursive formulation, the notes
  above suggest an iterative procedure with a supporting data structure.
  It's entirely  up to you if you implement this algorithm recursively or
  iteratively; both styles are reasonable here.
  
<h2>Turn in your code</h2>
<p>Submit your code via Autolab. If you think there's a problem with
the tests, please check the inline code specification carefully and
recheck your results.  You may also want to look at the specific test
that it's failing and try to reproduce that result. If it still looks
like the tests are incorrect, send me a message and if you're correct,
I'm happy to give you some extra credit points; however if you wait to
the last minute to send in a bug report, they are less valuable to
others in the class (and thus, in terms of extra credit) than if
they're turned in earlier.</p>
