Both tf-idf and bm-25 require the reverseIndex lib to function
This is because reverseIndex is used to create a reverse index
of all terms in the source file.
Arguments can be passed to BM_25 and TD_IDF as the inital
assignment would sugest. Files are passed though to reverseIndex

reverseIndex will generate debug statements for the string _word.
by default this is set to 'xxxx'. If this becomes an issue change
the string to something more obscure.
